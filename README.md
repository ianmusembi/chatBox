#### Additional Information
For instance where sender sends private message to a non-existing user , message will only be shown on
sender's browser as private message (in beige)

The first colon (':') that appears in the text from the user is used as the delimiter for the message
recepients and the message itself. Anything after the first colon, including other punctuation symbols will
be part of the message.
